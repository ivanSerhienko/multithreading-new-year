Santa Claus came on New Year's morning,
Snow Maiden and their assistants. Santa Claus from
Snow Maiden presents gifts to children from a bag (in
the bag contains a certain number of gifts), and
assistants replenish the bag. Assistant 1 (Rabbit)
can bring in a bag 2 gifts, the assistant 2
(Wolf) can bring 4 gifts in a bag. If
bag is empty - Santa Claus with Snow Maiden (and children)
have to wait if the bag is full - wait for
assistants. Organize the interaction of all participants
so that all children receive gifts and not
were forced to wait (initially there are several in the bag
gifts)
